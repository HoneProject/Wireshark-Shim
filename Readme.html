<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Host-Network (Hone) Packet-Process Correlator Wireshark Live-Capture Shim enables live capture from the Hone driver in
Wireshark. The Hone shim program, <tt>hone-dumpcap</tt>, sits between Wireshark and dumpcap (hence the name &ldquo;shim&rdquo;).</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Building"></a>Building</h2>

<p>The following software must be installed in order to build the shim:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><a href="https://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt 5.3</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to build the shim and Windows hook program</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads">Python 2.7</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to run the Windows build script (<i>Windows only</i>)</dd>

	<dt><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/">Visual Studio 2012</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to build the executables (<i>Windows only</i>)</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup 5.5</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to create the Windows installer executable (<i>Windows only</i>)</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="BuildingOnWindows"></a>Building on Windows</h3>

<p>On Windows, you can build an installer that includes the shim and a hook program to integrate the shim into Wireshark
installations. To build the installer, open a Qt 5.3 command window with Administrator privileges, change to the directory that
contains the Hone shim source code, and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
	build.py -v VERSION</pre>

Where <i>VERSION</i> is the version number to use for the build. Note that the Qt 5.3 command window must run as Administrator to
configure the Visual Studio 2012 environment properly, since Qt uses Visual Studio to compile the executables. If the Visual Studio
2012 environment isn't configured, the build script will show you how to configure the environment. To get help for the various
build options, run:

<pre>
	build.py -h</pre>

<p>The build script places the files in the <tt>hone_ws_<i>VERSION</i></tt> directory. The script will use Inno Setup to create
an installer, and, if successful, it will place an installer executable named <tt>Hone-WS-<i>VERSION</i>-win7.exe</tt> in the
<tt>installers</tt> subdirectory. It will also place the debugging symbols in the <tt>debug_symbols</tt> subdirectory.</p>

<h3><a name="BuildingOnLinux"></a>Building on Linux</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Open <tt>hone-dumpcap.pro</tt> in Qt Creator and click the <tt>Configure Project</tt> button</li>
	<li>Select Debug or Release build, and click the hammer icon in the lower left corner to build</li>
	<li>Qt Creator will create a program called <tt>hone-dumpcap</tt> in the selected build directory</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also build <tt>hone-dumpcap</tt> from the command line by running the following commands:</p>

<pre>
	mkdir build
	cd build
	qmake /path/to/hone-dumpcap.pro
	make</pre>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Installing"></a>Installing</h2>

<p>Prior to installing the shim, you should install a <a
href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Wireshark-Shim/wiki/Hone-Enhanced-Wireshark">Hone enhanced version of Wireshark</a> 1.10.2.
While the shim will work with a stock version of Wireshark 1.10.2, you will not be able to see the Hone-specific information added
to the <a href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor/wiki/Augmented-PCAP-Next-Generation-Dump-File-Format">augmented
PCAP-NG</a> file. If you use the shim with a different version of Wireshark, live captures from Wireshark may cease to function
properly.</p>

<h3><a name="InstallingOnWindows"></a>Installing on Windows</h3>

<p>Double-click on the installer file to run the installer, and follow the prompts. The installer will automatically add the shim
to any Wireshark installations under the standard 32-bit or 64-bit Program Files directories. It will also create shortcuts under
<tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Wireshark Live-Capture Shim</tt> to control the
shim.</p>

<p>If you have installed Wireshark in a non-standard location, you will need to manually add the shim to the Wireshark
installation:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the Wireshark shim folder in Windows Explorer (<tt>C:\Program Files\PNNL\Hone Wireshark Live-Capture Shim</tt> or
		<tt>C:\Program Files (x86)\PNNL\Hone Wireshark Live-Capture Shim</tt> by default).</li>
	<li>Select <tt>hone-dumpcap.exe</tt> and all of the DLLs</li>
	<li>Right-click and select <tt>Copy</tt></li>
	<li>Open the Wireshark installation folder in Windows Explorer</li>
	<li>Right-click and select <tt>Paste</tt></li>
	<li>Rename <tt>dumpcap.exe</tt> to <tt>dumpcap_orig.exe</tt></li>
	<li>Rename <tt>hone-dumpcap.exe</tt> to <tt>dumpcap.exe</tt></li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="InstallingOnLinux"></a>Installing on Linux</h3>

<p>There are two ways to install the shim on Linux.</p>

<h4>In an existing Wireshark directory</h4>

<p>This method is similar to the Windows installation, and may be required for Wireshark plugins to work while using the shim.
However, it is more intrusive than the second method.  To install in an existing Wireshark directory:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the Wireshark directory, rename <tt>dumpcap</tt> to <tt>dumpcap_orig</tt></li>
	<li>Copy <tt>hone-dumpcap</tt> to the Wireshark directory and rename it to <tt>dumpcap</tt></li>
</ol>

<h4>Using symlinks</h4>

<p>This method is less intrusive than installing in an existing Wireshark directory, but plugins may not work. To install using
symlinks:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a directory to hold the symlinks</li>
	<li>Create symlinks to <tt>wireshark</tt> and <tt>dumpcap</tt></li>
	<li>Copy <tt>hone-dumpcap</tt> to the directory and rename it to <tt>dumpcap</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if the directory is <tt>/opt/hone-wireshark</tt>, you would run:</p>

<pre>
	sudo mkdir /opt/hone-wireshark
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/wireshark /opt/hone-wireshark/wireshark
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/dumpcap /opt/hone-wireshark/dumpcap_orig
	sudo cp hone-dumpcap /opt/hone-wireshark/dumpcap</pre>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Uninstalling"></a>Uninstalling</h2>

<h3><a name="UninstallingOnWindows"></a>Uninstalling on Windows</h3>

<p>To uninstall the shim, use <tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Wireshark Live-Capture
Shim</tt> &rarr; <tt>Uninstall Hone Wireshark Live-Capture Shim</tt> or <tt>Programs and Features</tt> in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>If you manually added the shim to any Wireshark installations that are in non-standard locations, you will also need to manually
uninstall the shim:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the Wireshark installation folder in Windows Explorer</li>
	<li>Delete <tt>dumpcap.exe</tt></li>
	<li>Rename <tt>dumpcap_orig.exe</tt> to <tt>dumpcap.exe</tt></li>
	<li>Optionally, remove any DLLs that were copied over with the shim</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="UninstallingOnLinux"></a>Uninstalling on Linux</h3>

<h4>When installed in an existing Wireshark directory</h4>

<p>In the Wireshark directory, delete <tt>dumpcap</tt> and rename <tt>dumpcap_orig</tt> to <tt>dumpcap</tt>.</p>

<h4>When installed using symlinks</h4>

<p>Delete the <tt>/opt/hone-wireshark</tt> directory.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Using"></a>Using</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Ensure that Hone is installed, using the instructions for your system
		(<a href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor">Linux</a> or
		<a href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Windows-Sensor">Windows</a>)</li>
	<li>Run Wireshark as root (Linux) or Administrator (Windows)</li>
	<li>Select <tt>Hone</tt> from the list of interfaces</li>
	<li>Click <tt>Start</tt>
</ol>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Since the Hone driver requires root/Administrator access, Wireshark must also run as root or Administrator to provide the
		necessary privileges to the shim.</li>
	<li>You will need to add the shim back to the Wireshark installation in the following circumstances:
		<ul>
			<li>On Windows, if you install the shim before you install Wireshark</li>
			<li>On Windows, if you upgrade Wireshark</li>
			<li>On Linux, if you install the shim in an existing Wireshark directory and you upgrade Wireshark</li>
		</ul>
		To add the shim back to the Wireshark installation:
		<ul>
			<li>On Windows, run <tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Wireshark Live-Capture
				Shim</tt> &rarr; <tt>Set Wireshark Shim</tt></li>
			<li>On Linux, follow the installation instructions again</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>If you experience any problems with the Windows installation, you can use <tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>Programs</tt> &rarr;
		<tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Wireshark Live-Capture Shim</tt> &rarr; <tt>Unset Wireshark Shim</tt> to remove the shim from the
		Wireshark installation without uninstalling the program.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><a name="HowItWorks"></a>How It Works</h2>

<p>Wireshark uses the dumpcap program to capture data from network interfaces. It expects that dumpcap is installed in the same
directory as Wireshark, and that it is called <tt>dumpcap</tt> (Linux) or <tt>dumpcap.exe</tt> (Windows). Wireshark makes three
different types of calls to dumpcap:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get the list of interfaces</li>
	<li>Get link types for an interface</li>
	<li>Start capturing data from an interface</li>
</ol>

<p>Wireshark calls dumpcap with a special undocumented option, <tt>-Z</tt>, to tell it that it is a child of Wireshark. When
dumpcap is started with this option, it returns its output in a special format that Wireshark understands. The
<tt>hone-dumpcap</tt> shim implements the same options as dumpcap, and returns information for a special pseudo-interface called
<tt>Hone</tt> in the same format as dumpcap. It also calls the original dumpcap, renamed to <tt>dumpcap_orig</tt> (Linux) or
<tt>dumpcap_orig.exe</tt> (Windows), to handle requests from Wireshark for other network interfaces.</p>

<h3><a name="GettingListOfInterfaces"></a>Getting the List of Interfaces</h3>

<p>To get the list of interfaces, Wireshark calls dumpcap with the following options (adding <tt>.exe</tt> for Windows):</p>

<pre>
	dumpcap -D -Z none</pre>

<p>The shim calls the original dumpcap program to get the list of network interfaces, inserts the <tt>Hone</tt> device at the head
of the list, and writes the new list to stdout. For example (where <tt>\t</tt> is a tab and <tt>\0</tt> is a null):</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<pre>
	1. Hone\tHone capture pseudo-interface\tHone\t\t\tnetwork
	2. \Device\NPF_{A382A201-2748-4D83-9D45-B190A8AE0E8D}\tBroadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet Driver\tLocal Area Connection\tfe80::a5a9:f9ed:503a:78a7,203.0.113.10\tnetwork
	3. \Device\NPF_{E4EF329B-35BE-4BF6-9972-D633C95F7178}\tSun\tVirtualBox Host-Only Network\tfe80::98da:7db0:46ce:4863,192.168.42.13\tnetwork</pre>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<pre>
	1. Hone\t\tHone capture pseudo-interface\t0\t\tnetwork
	2. eth1\t\t\t0\t203.0.113.10\tnetwork
	3. any\t\tPseudo-device that captures on all interfaces\t0\t\tnetwork
	4. lo\t\tLoopback\t0\t127.0.0.1\tloopback</pre>

<p>The shim then writes a special command to stderr to tell Wireshark that it
finished successfully:</p>

<pre>
	S\0\0\0</pre>

<h3><a name="GettingLinkTypeForInterface"></a>Getting Link Types for an
Interface</h3>

<p>If the shim is called with an interface option of <tt>1</tt> or <tt>Hone</tt>, it handles the call itself. Otherwise, it passes
the call on to the original dumpcap, decrementing the interface indexes by one (since the interface indexes were all increased
by one when the shim inserted Hone at the head of the interface list).</p>

<p>When the shim handles the call itself, it simply returns a NULL link type, which has the same format on both Linux and
Windows:</p>

<pre>
	0
	0\tNULL\tNULL</pre>

<p>Again, the shim writes a special command to stderr to tell Wireshark that it finished successfully:</p>

<pre>
	S\0\0\0</pre>

<h3><a name="StartingDataCapture"></a>Starting Data Capture</h3>

<p>Similar to the way that the shim handles getting link types, if it is called with an interface option of <tt>1</tt> or
<tt>Hone</tt>, it handles the call itself, and if it is called with any other options, it passes the call on to the original
dumpcap. When it handles the call itself, there are a number of special commands that it needs to send back to Wireshark. All of
these commands go to stderr:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Capture file opened:</b> This is sent whenever the shim opens a new file to hold captured data. Wireshark reads the
		data from this file after the shim writes it. The command format is (with spaces between the elements for clarity):</p>

		<p><tt>F <i>lll</i> <i>filename</i>\0</tt></p>

		<p>Where <i>lll</i> is the three-byte length of the filename with the terminating null, and <i>filename</i> is the absolute
		path to the capture file. For example (where <tt>\nn</tt> is the hexadecimal byte value):</p>

		<pre>F \00\00\2f /tmp/hone_dumpcap_20130304093417_J28848.pcapng\0</pre></li>

	<li><p><b>Packet count:</b> This is sent whenever the shim writes captured data to the file. Even though the shim is writing
		PCAP-NG blocks, which may or may not be packet data, Wireshark still thinks in terms of packets. The command format is:</p>

		<p><tt>P <i>lll</i> <i>count</i>\0</tt></p>

		<p>Where <i>lll</i> is the three-byte length of the count string with the terminating null, and <i>count</i> is a
		decimal-formatted string with the number of PCAP-NG blocks written to the file since the last packet count report. For
		example:</p>

		<pre>P \00\00\04 109\0</pre></li>

	<li><p><b>Error message:</b> This is sent whenever the shim encounters an error. The command format is:</p>

		<p><tt>E <i>ttt</i> E <i>ppp</i> <i>pri</i>\0 E <i>sss</i> <i>sec</i>\0</tt></p>

		<p>Where <i>ttt</i> is the three-byte total error message length, <i>ppp</i> and <i>sss</i> are the three-byte lengths of the
		primary and secondary error messages with terminating nulls, respectively, and <i>pri</i> and <i>sec</i> are the primary and
		secondary error messages, respectively. Even if there is no secondary error message, the format still requires an empty
		null-terminated string. For example, if the shim cannot open the driver, the error message may be formatted as:</p>

		<pre>E \00\00\39 E \00\00\30 Cannot open driver /dev/hone: Permission denied\0 E \00\00\01 \0</pre></li>

</ul>

<p>When Wireshark is capturing data on Windows, it uses a named pipe to signal the shim to exit. The shim simply peeks at this pipe
periodically to check if the pipe still exists or if Wireshark has written any data to it. If the pipe doesn't exist, or if there
is any data, it assumes that Wireshark is signaling for it to exit. The pipe is not used for any other communication, and Wireshark
does not use it on Linux.</p>
